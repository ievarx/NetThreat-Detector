# NetThreat-Detector



### A network threat detection tool leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to capture and analyze network packets. This project uses a packet sniffer to capture data, stores it in a database, and uses AI models to identify potential network attacks. The tool is designed for real-time network traffic analysis and can help in detecting threats such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and other anomalies.
