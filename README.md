### **Optimized AI Model for DDoS POD Attack Detection - Graduation Project 2024-2025 ✅**  

📌 **This project is designed to detect DDoS POD attacks by analyzing network traffic using machine learning models.**  
📌 **It captures packets, analyzes them, and determines whether they are normal or part of an attack using pre-trained models.**

### **📂 Project Files:**

- **`Data_Generater.py`** → Generates synthetic network traffic data matching real patterns.  
- **`RealData_capture.py`** → Captures real network traffic for analysis.  
- **`PKL/`** → Contains pre-trained machine learning models for attack detection.
- **`GuiAppSniffer.py`** → A graphical interface for displaying and storing captured network packets.  
- **`Attacker.py`** → Simulates a DDoS POD attack to test the detection system.  
- **`main.py`** → The core script responsible for capturing and analyzing network packets.  
- **`models_traning.ipynb`** → A Jupyter Notebook used for training machine learning models.  
- **`setup.py`** → Installs all required dependencies for the project.
